        description: "I made this logo as my bid in a CrowdSpring project for a sports betting website. The intent was to be differnt than the other entries, the usual crest on some sort of sheild-like object made to look shiny with lots of curved edges. So I went with something angular and flat, but visually striking, evoking the power and aggression of those Greek elder gods."

        description: "This is the initial design for an email ad campaign, designed with responsiveness in mind. Most emails are read from mobile apps and browsers so scalability was a major concern. Getting the point across in an eye catching way while providing an experience that was consistent with the established brand's somewhat muted aesthetic sensibilities was also also a challenge."

        description: "This logo was commisioned by a friend looking into setting up an Amazon store to resell outdoor gear. It was made in duotone so it could be printed onto shipping boxes and bags easily, to increase brand visibility."

        description: "Pacidic Stormwater Consulting is a drain system consulting firm for drainage filters made for construction and industrial sites. the logo my team and I made was designed with resiliency in mind. Constant redesigns to keep up with fads and trends can make a company seem schizophrenic and unreliable. One single design that will work for years to come inspires confidence in potencial clients."

        source: nccf,
        description: "North Cascade Christian Fellowship felt they were visually stagnating, having kept the same design for their Sunday programs for over a year. I was hired as a freelancer to update their print collateral while maintaining their brand integrity. The result was a four page booklet that reflected the mission of the church while tying into the pride and beauty of living in the North Cascades of Washington State."
